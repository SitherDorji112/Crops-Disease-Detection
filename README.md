# Project Overview
Crop Disease Detection Using Computer Vision and Deep Learning is a machine learning project designed to assist farmers and researchers in detecting plant diseases from leaf images. The system leverages deep learning for accurate and efficient disease classification, including an “Unknown” class for leaves that do not belong to any known disease category.

# Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python
- Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras
- Image Processing: OpenCV
- Web Deployment: Django
- Model Architecture: MobileNetV2

# Dataset
The dataset consists of 41,639 leaf images from 7 different crops, covering 26 classes including healthy leaves, various diseases, and an Unknown class with 311 images for leaves that don’t match any known category. Preprocessing and data augmentation were applied to improve model generalization and performance.

# Model Details
- Architecture: MobileNetV2 CNN
- Training: Data augmentation applied to enhance generalization
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Performance: Validation accuracy of 88.33%

# Use Cases
- Early detection of crop diseases for farmers
- Aid researchers in agricultural studies
- Promote sustainable farming practices through AI

# Results
- High accuracy in classifying multiple crop diseases
- Real-time predictions with confidence scores
- Enhanced accessibility for farmers and researchers
