Crop Disease Detection Using Computer Vision and Deep Learning is a machine learning project designed to assist farmers and researchers in detecting plant diseases from leaf images. 
The system is built using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV, employing the MobileNetV2 CNN model for efficient classification across 25 disease classes from seven different crops. 
Data preprocessing and augmentation were performed to enhance model generalization, and performance evaluation was based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
The final trained model achieved an overall validation accuracy of 88.33%. For practical demonstration, the model is locally deployed using Django, allowing users to upload or capture 
leaf images and obtain real-time disease predictions with confidence scores. This project highlights the integration of AI and agriculture, promoting early disease detection, sustainable 
farming practices, and accessible digital solutions for crop health monitoring.
