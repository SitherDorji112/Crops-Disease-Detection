# Project Overview
Crop Disease Detection Using Computer Vision and Deep Learning is a machine learning project designed to assist farmers and researchers in detecting plant diseases from leaf images. The system leverages deep learning for accurate and efficient disease classification, including an “Unknown” class for leaves that do not belong to any known disease category.

# Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python
- Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras
- Image Processing: OpenCV
- Web Deployment: Django
- Model Architecture: MobileNetV2
